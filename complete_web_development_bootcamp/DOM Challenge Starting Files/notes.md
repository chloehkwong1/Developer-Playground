The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents (Web API). It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. i.e. so pages can change automatically

A web page is a document that can be either displayed in the browser window or as the HTML source. In both cases, it is the same document but the Document Object Model (DOM) representation allows it to be manipulated. As an object-oriented representation of the web page, it can be modified with a scripting language such as JavaScript.

Methods are functions that an object can do e.g.
```
click()
appendChild()
setAttribute()
```
An object also has properties e.g.
```
innerHTML
style
firstChild
```

We can access these properties and methods via the dot notation, and by doing this we can manipulate the HTML objects.
