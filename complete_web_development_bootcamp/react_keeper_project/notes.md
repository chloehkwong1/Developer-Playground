# React

By convention, we always create a div html element with an id of root and this is going to be the root of the application,  `<div id="root"></div>`

### Babel
Babel is a javascript compiler that compiles next-gen javascript (e.g. ES6) down to brower-compatible javascript. 

### `ReactDOM.render()`
`ReactDOM.render(<what you what to be displayed>, <where you want it to be displayed>)` can only take one html element at a time. 

## Unrelated but useful to know

`<script>` tags allow you to put javascript in html.
